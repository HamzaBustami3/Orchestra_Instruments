<h1> 
    String Instruments
</h1>
<p>
    The String Instruments are the stars of the orchestra and those who are in the front for the public to see. While they don't produce all the music heard, they tend to have by far the most people in any group in orchestra. Although they may look extremely similar, they are extremely diverse in sound and selection. The main string instruments in orchestra are Violin (of course), Viola, Cello, Double Bass, and Harp.
</p>
<h3> String instruments are played by drawing a bow across a set of strings, or by plucking the strings with the fingers.
