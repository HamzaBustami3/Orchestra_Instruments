		The Orchestra is a set of many different instruments that group to make a wonderful sound and basis for many different pieces. These groups of musicians and instruments are typically accompanied by a conductor and leader whom guides the orchestra and keeps the orchestra on time and organized, similar to drummers or band leaders in conventional modern-bands. Orchestras are responsible for recordings of beautiful symphonies and other orchestral-pieces. But what are these weird instruments you speak of weird mortal? What in the bejeebers is an oboe? that sounds like a foot infection. First of all, how dare you disrespect a musical INSTRUMENT YOU UNCULTURED SWI- whoo no no we are not doing this again. Learn and find out together.>
